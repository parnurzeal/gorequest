#### "Shooting Requests like a Machine Gun" - Gopher

Sending request would never been fun and easier than this. It comes with lots of feature:

* Get/Post/Put/Head/Delete/Patch
* Set - simple header setting
* JSON - made it simple with JSON string as a parameter
* Proxy - sending request via proxy
* Timeout - setting timeout for a request
* TLSClientConfig - taking control over tls where at least you can disable security check for https
* RedirectPolicy
* Cookie - setting cookies for your request
* CookieJar - automatic in-memory cookiejar
* BasicAuth - setting basic authentication header
* more to come..

## Installation

## Why should you use GoRequest?

GoRequest makes thing much more simple for you, making http client more awesome and fun like SuperAgent + golang style usage.

This is what you normally do for a simple GET without GoRequest:

```go
resp, err := http.Get("http://example.com/")
```

With GoRequest:

```go
request := gorequest.New()
resp, body, errs := request.Get("http://example.com/").End()
```

Or below if you don't want to reuse it for other requests.

```go
resp, body, errs := gorequest.New().Get("http://example.com/").End()
```

How about getting control over HTTP client headers, redirect policy, and etc. Things is getting more complicated in golang. You need to create a Client, setting header in different command, ... to do just only one __GET__

```go
client := &http.Client{
  CheckRedirect: redirectPolicyFunc,
}

req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://example.com", nil)

req.Header.Add("If-None-Match", `W/"wyzzy"`)
resp, err := client.Do(req)
```

Why making things ugly while you can just do as follows:

```go
request := gorequest.New()
resp, body, errs := request.Get("http://example.com").
  RedirectPolicy(redirectPolicyFunc).
  Set("If-None-Match", `W/"wyzzy"`).
  End()
```

__DELETE__, __HEAD__, __POST__, __PUT__, __PATCH__ are now supported and can be used the same way as __GET__:

```go
request := gorequest.New()
resp, body, errs := request.Post("http://example.com").End()
// PUT -> request.Put("http://example.com").End()
// DELETE -> request.Delete("http://example.com").End()
// HEAD -> request.Head("http://example.com").End()
```

### JSON

For a __JSON POST__ with standard libraries, you might need to marshal map data structure to json format, setting header to 'application/json' (and other headers if you need to) and declare http.Client. So, you code become longer and hard to maintain:

```go
m := map[string]interface{}{
  "name": "backy",
  "species": "dog",
}
mJson, _ := json.Marshal(m)
contentReader := bytes.NewReader(mJson)
req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "http://example.com", contentReader)
req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
req.Header.Set("Notes","GoRequest is coming!")
client := &http.Client{}
resp, _ := client.Do(req)
```

Compared to our GoRequest version, JSON is for sure a default. So, it turns out to be just one simple line!:

```go
request := gorequest.New()
resp, body, errs := request.Post("http://example.com").
  Set("Notes","gorequst is coming!").
  Send(`{"name":"backy", "species":"dog"}`).
  End()
```

Moreover, it also supports struct type. So, you can have a fun __Mix & Match__ sending the different data types for your request:

```go
type BrowserVersionSupport struct {
  Chrome string
  Firefox string
}
ver := BrowserVersionSupport{ Chrome: "37.0.2041.6", Firefox: "30.0" }
request := gorequest.New()
resp, body, errs := request.Post("http://version.com/update").
  Send(ver).
  Send(`{"Safari":"5.1.10"}`).
  End()
```

Not only for Send() but Query() is also supported. Just give it a try! :)

## Callback

Moreover, GoRequest also supports callback function. This gives you much more flexibility on using it. You can use it any way to match your own style!
Let's see a bit of callback example:

```go
func printStatus(resp gorequest.Response, body string, errs []error){
  fmt.Println(resp.Status)
}
gorequest.New().Get("http://example.com").End(printStatus)
```

## Proxy

In the case when you are behind proxy, GoRequest can handle it easily with Proxy func:

```go
request := gorequest.New().Proxy("http://proxy:999")
resp, body, errs:= request.Get("http://example-proxy.com").End()
// To reuse same client with no_proxy, use empty string:
resp, body, errs= request.Proxy("").("http://example-no-proxy.com").End()
```

## Basic Authentication

To add a basic authentication header:

```go
resp, body, errs := request.Get("http://example-proxy.com").SetBasicAuth("username", "password").End()
```

## Timeout

Timeout can be set in any time duration using time package:

```go
request := gorequest.New().Timeout(2*time.Millisecond)
resp, body, errs:= request.Get("http://example.com").End()
```

Timeout func defines both dial + read/write timeout to the specified time parameter.

## Noted
As the underlying gorequest is based on http.Client in most usecases, gorequest.New() should be called once and reuse gorequest as much as possible.
